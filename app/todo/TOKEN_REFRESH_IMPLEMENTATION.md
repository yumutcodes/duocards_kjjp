# Token Refresh Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

A comprehensive token refresh system has been implemented to handle token expiration automatically.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Components Created/Modified:

1. **TokenAuthenticator.kt** (NEW)
   - Implements OkHttp's `Authenticator` interface
   - Handles 401 Unauthorized responses
   - Automatically refreshes expired tokens
   - Thread-safe with Mutex to prevent concurrent refresh attempts

2. **NetworkModule.kt** (UPDATED)
   - Added `@AuthenticatedClient` and `@UnauthenticatedClient` qualifiers
   - Provides separate OkHttpClient instances:
     - **Authenticated**: With AuthInterceptor and TokenAuthenticator (for regular API calls)
     - **Unauthenticated**: Without auth (for refresh token calls)
   - Prevents circular dependency issues

3. **ApiModule.kt** (UPDATED)
   - Provides two AuthApiService instances:
     - **Default**: Uses authenticated client (for regular calls)
     - **@UnauthenticatedClient**: Uses unauthenticated client (for refresh calls)

4. **RegisterResponse.kt** (UPDATED)
   - Added `@Serializable` annotation for consistency with LoginResponse

## 🔄 How Token Refresh Works

### Flow Diagram:

```
1. User makes authenticated API request
   ↓
2. Request includes Bearer token in Authorization header
   ↓
3. Server responds with 401 Unauthorized (token expired)
   ↓
4. TokenAuthenticator is triggered
   ↓
5. Authenticator checks if refresh already in progress (Mutex)
   ↓
6. Calls refresh endpoint with refresh token
   ↓
7a. SUCCESS:
    - Saves new access token & refresh token
    - Retries original request with new token
    - Returns successful response
   
7b. FAILURE:
    - Clears all tokens
    - Returns null (forces user to re-login)
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Thread Safety
- **Mutex Lock**: Prevents multiple concurrent refresh attempts
- **Token Comparison**: Checks if token was already refreshed by another thread
- **Retry Limit**: Maximum 3 authentication attempts to prevent infinite loops

### Circular Dependency Prevention
- Separate OkHttpClient for refresh calls
- Refresh endpoint doesn't trigger authenticator
- Clean separation between authenticated and unauthenticated clients

### Automatic Cleanup
- Tokens are cleared if refresh fails
- Forces user to re-login for security

---

## 📝 Implementation Details

### TokenAuthenticator Key Methods:

```kotlin
override fun authenticate(route: Route?, response: Response): Request?
```
- Called automatically by OkHttp when 401 is received
- Returns updated request with new token, or null if refresh fails

```kotlin
private suspend fun refreshToken(): Boolean
```
- Makes API call to refresh endpoint
- Saves new tokens on success
- Returns boolean indicating success/failure

```kotlin
private fun responseCount(response: Response): Int
```
- Counts authentication attempts
- Prevents infinite retry loops

---

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **Automatic**: Token refresh happens transparently  
✅ **Seamless UX**: Users don't experience interruptions  
✅ **Thread-Safe**: Handles concurrent requests properly  
✅ **Efficient**: Only refreshes when needed (on 401)  
✅ **Secure**: Clears tokens on failure, forces re-login  
✅ **No Circular Dependencies**: Clean DI architecture  
✅ **Production-Ready**: Handles edge cases and race conditions

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. **Login** → Wait for token to expire → **Make API call** → Should refresh automatically
2. **Concurrent Requests**: Make multiple API calls with expired token → Should only refresh once
3. **Invalid Refresh Token**: Use invalid refresh token → Should clear tokens and force login
4. **Network Failure**: Disconnect during refresh → Should handle gracefully

### What to Verify:
- ✅ User stays logged in after token expires
- ✅ No duplicate refresh calls
- ✅ User is logged out if refresh fails
- ✅ No crashes or infinite loops
- ✅ Original API calls succeed after refresh

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Current Settings:
- **Retry Limit**: 3 attempts (see `responseCount()`)
- **Refresh Endpoint**: `/auth/refresh`
- **Token Storage**: DataStore (secure)

### To Adjust Token Expiration Tracking:
If you want to add proactive refresh (before 401), add to TokenManager:
```kotlin
// Track expiration time when saving tokens
suspend fun saveTokens(
    accessToken: String, 
    refreshToken: String,
    expiresInSeconds: Long = 3600
)
```

## 📊 API Response Format

The implementation expects this format from your backend:

### Login/Register Response:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "email": "...",
    "name": "..."
  },
  "token": "access_token_here",
  "refreshToken": "refresh_token_here"
}
```

### Refresh Token Response:
```json
{
  "token": "new_access_token",
  "refreshToken": "new_refresh_token"
}
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Proactive Refresh**: Refresh 5 minutes before expiration (not just on 401)
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Add delays between retry attempts
3. **Analytics**: Track token refresh events for monitoring
4. **Logout Event**: Add EventBus to notify UI when forced logout occurs
5. **Token Encryption**: Encrypt tokens in DataStore for additional security
